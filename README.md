# random-paper-implementations

A repo where I implement condition monitoring methodologies.

This repository is organised in a format where each directory represents an implementation of a paper. This directory will contain a README.md that details, at a minimum:
1. The formatted citation and the bibtex entry for the work.
2. A simple summary of the work/methodology proposed by the author.
